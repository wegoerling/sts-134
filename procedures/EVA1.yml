procedure_name: STS-134 EVA 1

# Actors _probably_ don't need to be defined anymore. Instead define columns,
# since what actor gets applied to what column needs to be defined at the
# procedure level. Actors can be added on the fly. Perhaps at some point a list
# of valid actors could/should be added at the procedure level to validate for
# typos or otherwise unexpected actors being added to a procedure.

#   - role: IV
